# FabricDisc
A basic Fabric mod that links a server to a discord channel


## Usage
This mod is server-side only, it is useless on a client.

1) Run the server once to create the config files

2) Edit the configs with the token of your discord bot, the server id and the channel id (don't forget to activate developer mode in discord settings)
